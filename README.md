# Password Complexity Checker
Imagine you're creating a password for an important account, like your email or online banking. You want to make sure your password is strong enough to protect your information from unauthorized access. This code helps you determine the strength of your password by checking for various criteria. The check_password_complexity function is like a security guard for your password. It inspects the password you provide and evaluates its strength based on specific rules. To decide if a password is strong, moderate, or weak, the function looks for certain qualities: your password should be at least 8 characters long to resist simple attacks, it's good to include at least one uppercase letter for added complexity, similarly, including at least one lowercase letter makes the password more secure, including at least one digit (0-9) adds another layer of security, and using special characters like !@#$%^&*(),.?":{}|<> makes the password even stronger. Based on whether the password meets these criteria, the function categorizes its strength: if the password satisfies all criteria, it's labeled as "Strong." This means it's highly secure. If the password is at least 8 characters long, contains either uppercase or lowercase letters (or both), and includes at least one digit, it's classified as "Moderate." While not as secure as a strong password, it still provides decent protection. If the password doesn't meet any of the above criteria, it's considered "Weak." This indicates that it's vulnerable to attacks and should be strengthened. In the main function, the user is prompted to enter their password. The check_password_complexity function is then called to assess the password's strength. Finally, the result (strong, moderate, or weak) is displayed to the user, providing feedback on the password's security level.erable to attacks and should be strengthened.
User Interaction: In the main function, the user is prompted to enter their password. The check_password_complexity function is then called to assess the password's strength. Finally, the result (strong, moderate, or weak) is displayed to the user, providing feedback on the password's security level.
